Description:

This project is a web scraping application that fetches the top 5 trending topics from Twitter's homepage using Selenium. It utilizes ProxyMesh to rotate IP addresses for each request and stores the results in a MongoDB database. The scraped data can be viewed on a simple HTML page by clicking a button that triggers the scraping script.

File Structure:

app.py: Flask application to serve the HTML page and handle the button click to run the Selenium script.
main.py: Contains the main script to perform web scraping using Selenium, store data in MongoDB, and handle ProxyMesh.
templates/index.html: HTML template for the main page.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required for the project.

Instructions:

Install MongoDB and ensure it is running.
Install ChromeDriver and ensure it is in your system PATH.
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
Install Python dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Flask app using python app.py.
Access the app in your web browser and click the button to fetch Twitter trends.
View the scraped data on the HTML page.

Note:
